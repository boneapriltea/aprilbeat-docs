# Get Started into Aprilbeat

Let's discover **Aprilbeat in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new aprilbeat account** with the new **[login area](https://aprilbeat.vercel.app/auth)**.

If you were directly redirected back to the game after visiting the login area, it likely means that you are already signed in.

## Find and Download Beatmaps

You can find and download beatmaps inside the game with the **beatmap selector**. Custom beatmaps can also be made by users outside of the Aprilbeat team easily with the **beatmap creator tool**.
